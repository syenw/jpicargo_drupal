INTRODUCTION
------------

 * This module allows you to create fields that store passwords. It will store
   the passwords in encrypted format and (by default) will not display them on
   the website. So this module is really only useful in conjunction with other
   modules that can access the data through the API it provides.

 * For a full description of the module, visit the project page:
   https://www.drupal.org/project/password_field

 * To submit bug reports and feature suggestions, or to track changes:
   https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/password_field


INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install the Password Field module as you would normally install a
   contributed Drupal module.

 * We prefer that you install this module using COMPOSER like run this
   command (composer require 'drupal/password_field:1.x-dev') in the
   Drupal site root folder.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

 * The module has no menu or modifiable settings. There is no configuration.
   When enabled, the Password field will appear while selecting field type.
